Number: Privacy Policy
Welcome to the number learning game for Android!

This is an open source Android application developed by Fian Rahardian. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; This app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user, I am very concerned about privacy. I know how annoying it is when an app collects your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (such as themes, etc.) and alarms) created by you are only stored on your device, and can be easily deleted by deleting the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find a security vulnerability accidentally caused by me, or have any questions about how the app protects your privacy, send me an email and I'll definitely try to fix it/help you.

Yours faithfully,
Fian Rahardian.
